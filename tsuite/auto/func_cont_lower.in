title exercise continuum lowering

# 
# grid_extreme has a history of instability in the chemistry solver
# in the low-T, high-n corner. We do not want to be hampered by that,
# so disable the chemical network
no molecules
#
# the number of levels is chosen such that continuum lowering will remove
# resolved levels for hydrogen and only collapsed levels for helium

database h-like hydrogen collapsed levels 25

modified from one of the four corners of grid_extreme, 
the purpose of the sim is to test the interaction of
continuum lowering with the iso sequences
