# Cloudy

Cloudy is an _ab initio_ spectral synthesis code designed to model a wide range
of interstellar "clouds", from H II regions and planetary nebulae, to Active
Galactic Nuclei, and the hot intracluster medium that permeates galaxy clusters.

Cloudy has been in continuous development since 1978, led by Gary Ferland, and
in close collaboration with a number of scientists -- see the
[list of contributors](others.txt).


# Version

The current version of Cloudy is C22, released in Fall 2022.
A summary of what is new is available
[here](https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy/-/wikis/NewC22).

## Brief History

Cloudy recently migrated to a pure git version control system from a
subversion (SVN) system (with limited support for git).
Cloudy had been on a SVN repository for about 15 years, which is still 
maintained as a read-only reference at
[https://viewvc.nublado.org](https://viewvc.nublado.org) or
[https://trac.nublado.org/browser](https://trac.nublado.org/browser).

The migration was done on 2020 Dec 2 at r14364.
Only the trunk and a few actively maintained branches were migrated.

Previous releases of Cloudy are still available on the SVN site,
as well as tarballs on our
[release folder](https://data.nublado.org/cloudy_releases).
