 saving line data, then stopping

 The code is left in a disturbed state after creating the SAVE LINE DATA file.
 No calculation is actually performed, only the SAVE LINE DATA file is produced.
 Remove the SAVE LINE DATA command to do the calculation.

 ChkMonitorend is ok.
 [Stop in SaveLineData at save_linedata.cpp:242, Cloudy exited OK]
