# Stout Data Format as of January 8, 2013

_Check [Stout Data Wiki](http://www.nublado.org/wiki/StoutData) for updates._

## File Structure

Stout data files are stored in the `data/stout/<element>/<element>_#/` directory.

Each Stout species has three files:

- `<element>_#.nrg` — **Energy level file**
- `<element>_#.tp` — **Transition probability file**
- `<element>_#.coll` — **Collision data file**

A masterlist file determines which Stout species are enabled.  
The default masterlist file is `Stout.ini` in the `data/Stout/masterlist/` directory.

---

## General File Format

- The first line of each Stout file is a **version number**.
- Lines starting with `#` are **comments**.
- Data fields are **tab/space delimited**.
- A line of stars (`********`) marks the **end of data** in each file. The stars should start in the first column after the last line of data.

---

## Energy Level File (`<element>_#.nrg`)

- **4 data fields per energy level:**
  1. **Energy level index**
  2. **Energy in wavenumbers**
  3. **Statistical weight (g)**
  4. **State information** (optional)

- Experimental energies are used to derive observed wavelengths.
- Energies do **not** need to be in increasing order; the code will sort and correct indices as needed.

---

## Transition Probability File (`<element>_#.tp`)

- **Up to 5 data fields per transition:**
  1. **Type**:  
     - `A` for Einstein A  
     - `G` for gf  
     - `S` for line strength
  2. **Lower level of the transition**
  3. **Upper level of the transition**
  4. **Value**: Aul, gf, or line strength (depending on Field 1)
  5. **Transition type** (required for line strength data):  
     - `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, `M1`, `M2`, or `M3`

- Transition probabilities are **cumulative**; multiple entries for a transition are added together.

---

## Collision Data File (`<element>_#.coll`)

- **Two types of data rows:**
  - **Temperature rows**: Start with `TEMP`, followed by temperature data points (Kelvin).
  - **Collision Data rows**: Start with a designation keyword, followed by lower and upper levels, then collision data values.

- The **first line** after the version number (excluding comments) must be a **Temperature row**.
- The number of temperature points must match the number of collision data points for all associated lines.
- To set a new temperature scale, add a new Temperature row followed by its Collision Data rows.
- Collision Data rows are associated with the closest preceding Temperature row.

**Example designation keywords:**

- `CS ELECTRON` — electron collision strengths
- `RATE PROTON` — proton rate coefficients
