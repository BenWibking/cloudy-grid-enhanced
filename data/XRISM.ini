# to simulate RESOLVE data from XRISM
# The JAXA team routinely increased our default continuum resolution
# by a factor of ten. This increased resolution applies to the
# entire SED. We could have increased only the X-ray by changing
# continuum_mesh.ini, but that would change the default setup for all sims.
# Note that it will be necessary to recompile the grain opacity data
# for this new resolution. See "Compile grains" in Hazy 1.
